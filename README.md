# 🏦 Bank Account Management System (Python OOP)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a Bank Account Management System developed using Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
It simulates real-world banking operations such as deposits, withdrawals, balance checking, and transaction history tracking.

The project focuses on clean OOP design, real-world logic, and proper separation of responsibilities, similar to backend systems.

## 🎯 Features
- Create a bank account
- Deposit money with validation
- Withdraw money with balance checks
- Maintain transaction history
- Timestamp for each transaction
- Readable transaction output using __str__
- Modular and clean project structure

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- time module

## 🧩 OOP Concepts Used
- Classes & Objects
- Encapsulation
- Composition
- Constructors (__init__)
- Method design
- Special method (__str__)
- Separation of concerns

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bank-account-oops-python.git

2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd bank-account-oops-python

3. Run the program:
   python main.py

## 📌 Sample Output
Deposit successful
Withdrawal successful

Current Balance: 4500

Transaction History:
DEPOSIT of 2000 at Thu Jan 16 11:20:30 2025
WITHDRAW of 1000 at Thu Jan 16 11:21:10 2025

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Designing real-world systems using Python OOP
- Separating business logic from data models
- Handling transactions like real backend systems
- Writing clean and maintainable code
- Structuring a multi-file Python project

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- File handling to persist data
- Multiple account support
- Database integration
- REST API using Django
